1. remove all inline and <head> styles and put them in the external stylesheet so that you no longer need the !important for background-color
2. center the slogan and make it italic using an ID selector
3. float the aside to the right and add 10px of margin to its left and bottom sides
4. then make the article width the same width as the aside and float it left
